It appears I'm caught in an infinite do-loop, trying to install Genesis Title Toggle with Wordpress Multisite. I think I understand what the problem is. Your plugin checks to make sure that the Genesis Framework is installed, and if it doesn't detect an active installtion, refuses to proceed on the install. Problem is, Multisite does not allow users to install themes and plugins on a per-site basis. You must go to a Network settings page, where you can then install both themes and plugins to be used by any or all of the sites. But the network settings section exists outside of all the multisite sites. So when you're in the net config mode, there is no Wordpress site to poll to see if Genesis Framework is installed. 

I suspect just removing the check for the presence of Genesis, and it should work. Then again, I'm not a software engineer, and I don't write plugins, so I would assume you would know far better than I, how to fix this.
